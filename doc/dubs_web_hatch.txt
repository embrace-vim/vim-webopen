2. Web Hatch Commands			*dubs-web-hatch-commands*

Web Hatch Commands~

							*gW*
gW			Opens a new browser window with the location of the
			URL under the cursor. Similar to Vim's builtin "gf"
			and "gF" commands that open the file path found under
			the cursor. Works from normal mode.

							*gW*
g!			Like "gW", but opens location in an incognito (aka
			private) browser window. Works from normal mode.

							*<Leader>W*
<Leader>W		Opens a browser tab and searches the word under the
			cursor (normal or insert mode) or the selected text
			(visual mode).

							*<Leader>D*
<Leader>D		Opens a browser tab and loads the definitions of the
			word under the cursor (normal or insert mode) or the
			selected text (visual mode).

3. Web Hatch Configuration		*dubs-web-hatch-configuration*

Default Browser~

On Linux (Debian), this plugin calls `sensible-browser --version` to
determine which browser to use.

- Use the `$BROWSER` environ to set your default browser.

  - E.g., include this in your `~/.bashrc` if you prefer Chrome:

      `export BROWSER=/usr/bin/google-chrome`

  - For the best documentation on `sensible-browser`, see the source,
    which you might find at:

      `/usr/bin/sensible-browser`

On macOS, this plugin reads the user's `LaunchServices` property list
looking for the default browser to use.

- Run the browser you want to be the default, and look for an option
  within the browser to set it as the default.

Please feel free to open a pull request to add support for additional OSes.

Tab or Window~

By default, each command opens a new browser tab in new window.

- To instead prefer opening a new tab in an existing window,
  set the following global variable to nonzero, e.g.,:

    `g:dubs_web_hatch_use_tab = 1`

User Profile~

By default, when Chrome is opened, the default user profile is used.

- To instead open a window using the most recently used profile,
  set the following global variable to nonzero, e.g.,:

    `g:dubs_web_hatch_mru_profile = 1`

Supported Browsers~

This plugin works with the following browsers:

- On Debian: Google Chrome, Chromium, and Mozilla Firefox.

- On macOS: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.

Note that Safari does not accept command line arguments, so it does not
respect tab vs. window, nor can it open a location in incognito mode.

Please feel free to open a pull request to add support for additional browsers.
