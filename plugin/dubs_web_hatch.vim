" - The following web_open_url() function is inspired by:
"       https://stackoverflow.com/a/53817071
"   albeit I fixed an issue with shellescape being called before checking for
"   the empty string (which shellescape would put quotes around, so it'd no
"   longer be empty).
"   - I also swapped `open` for `sensible-browser`. `open` is for macOS. (And
"     `xdg-open` is more for Linux, but `sensible-browser` is more literal.)
" - That SO post was (possibly) inspired by (or at least referenced from):
"      https://stackoverflow.com/a/9459366
"   which tells users to try Vim's builtin `gx`, but I have issues with `gx`.
" - See also another plugin I found:
"       https://github.com/henrik/vim-open-url
"   Which uses more rebost regex as described by the Markdown author:
"       https://daringfireball.net/2010/07/improved_regex_for_matching_urls
"   But so far I've run across no limitations with the simpler regex used here.
" - The (an)other plugin also claims to work when two URLs are on the same row, e.g.,
"       " http://example.com/#foo and http://example.com/?foo=bar#baz "
"   but when I tested, all I saw was the line being echoed, and nothing more.
"   - With the code herein, if 2 URLs are on the same line, the first is opened.
"   - Which is fine for my use case: I have URLs in notes files, but never two
"     on the same line, which -- without a magic open-URL function -- is useful
"     for copying a URL that you intend to paste to a browser, as you can just
"     copy the whole line (including newline) with a few keystrokes (and the
"     browser will strip leading and trailing whitespace when you paste).
"   - You also have to set the opener with the (an)other plugin, e.g.,
"       let g:open_url_browser="xdg-open"
"     which is probably something I could adapt here (because I think Linux
"     and macOS support `sensible-browser`, but not Windows).
" - There's also the Vim builtin `gx`, but I have issues with `gx` always
"   calling `wget` on the URL, no matter how I configure it.
"   - For instance, even when I specified the browser opener:
"       let g:netrw_browsex_viewer = "sensible-browser"
"     `gx` would still `wget` the resource first, and then open the temporary
"     download file path in my browser. Heh?!
"     - I also tried other vectors:
"       - This wgets the URL under cursor to /tmp/some-dir/, then replaces
"         my open file in Vim with a blank file (and Ctrl-j doesn't go back!):
"           let g:netrw_browsex_viewer = "xdg-open"
"       - This opens the downloaded resource to a GUI text editor (not Vim):
"           let g:netrw_browsex_viewer = "setsid xdg-open"
"       - This opens the dowloaded resource in my browser, with a temporary path,
"         e.g., file:///tmp/vuzpUag/116, and also replaces current Vim buffer with
"         a new one (closing/wiping the previous buffer, so Ctrl-J does nothing):
"           let g:netrw_browsex_viewer = "sensible-browser"
" - This leaves only one feature that the (an)other plugin offers, which is
"   to handle special URLs, like Spotify, e.g.,
"       spotify:track:6JEK0CvvjDjjMUBFoXShNZ
"   which is novel, but not a feature that I see myself starting to use.
